# C Integer Division by Zero

This repository demonstrates a common error in C programming: division by zero.  The code attempts to divide an integer by zero, which results in undefined behavior. This can lead to program crashes, incorrect outputs, or unpredictable results.

The `bug.c` file contains the erroneous code. The `bugSolution.c` file provides a corrected version that handles potential division by zero.

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling and input validation in C programs to prevent such runtime errors.
